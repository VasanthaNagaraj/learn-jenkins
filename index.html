The master is the base installation of the Jenkins tool and does the basic operations and serves the user interface while the slaves do the actual work.
The main server of Jenkins is the Jenkins Master. It is a web dashboard which is nothing but powered from a war file. By default, it runs on 8080 port. With the help of Dashboard, we can configure the jobs/projects but the build takes place in Nodes/Slave. By default, one node (slave) is configured and running in Jenkins server. We can add more nodes  using IP address, user name and password using the ssh, jnlp or webstart methods.
The server's job or master's job is to handle:
  Scheduling build jobs.
  Dispatching builds to the nodes/slaves for the actual execution.
  Monitor the nodes/slaves (possibly taking them online and offline as required).
  Recording and presenting the build results.
  A Master/Server instance of Jenkins can also execute build jobs directly.
Jenkins Slave
A slave is just a device that is configured to act as an executor on behalf of the master.A Slave is a Java executable that runs on a remote machine. Following are the characteristics of Jenkins Slaves:
  It hears requests from the Jenkins Master instance.
  Slaves can run on a variety of operating systems.
  The job of a Slave is to do as they are told to, which involves executing build jobs  dispatched by the Master.
  You can configure a project to always run on a particular Slave machine, or a  particular type of Slave machine, or simply let Jenkins pick the next available Slave.
 
Jenkins Slaves are genera ly required to provide the desired environment. It works on the basis of request received from Jenkins Master.
Now let us look at an example in which Jenkins is used for testing in different environments like: Ubuntu, MAC, Windows etc.
